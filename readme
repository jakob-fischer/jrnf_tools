This tool enables the generation of reaction networks with different types of 
specific complex network types. For this a c++ library locatet in the subdirectory
"net_tools" is used. This library includes also a list of sample networks. For 
details on the library look at the readme file locatet in "net_tools".

For results generated with the help of this tool (and theoretical explanations)
look at the following publication:
  [FKD15] J Fischer, A Kleidon, and P Dittrich. “Thermodynam-
          ics of Random Reaction Networks.” In: PLoS ONE 10.2
          (2015), e0117312.
